I made a pokeball from Pokemon! 
Hi, My project is a Pokeball from Pokemon. The main functions of the pokeball is to vibrate and glow. These functions can be turned off and on together using a button. 
This is my first time building a PCB, and it was fairly challenging. I learned a lot while designing this, and I really hope to learn more about electrical components
Bill of materials-

Battery,
Resistor,
Button,
LED,
Motor,
Potentiometer

This was my first time making a pcb and I kept this project simple, and explored how circuits work!
